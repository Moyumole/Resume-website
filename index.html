<h3 id="nhl-season-2022-2023-player-salaries-analysis">NHL season (2022-2023) player salaries analysis</h3>
<p>Use different economic methods to analyze and predict player salaries. 
Estimating the impact on salary in percentage terms of different hockey statistics.</p>
<h3 id="analyze-the-impact-of-the-covid-gap-on-manitoba-s-labour-force">Analyze the impact of the &quot;Covid Gap&quot; on Manitoba&#39;s labour force</h3>
<p>Use an economic model to explain the labor force characteristics of the different population groups
in the previous decade before the pandemic (2010-2019) and then predict outcomes for 2020 and
2021 during Covid-19</p>
<h3 id="medieval-village-game-scene-design">Medieval village game scene design</h3>
<p>A simple medieval village game scene and a simple cutscene were created using
Unreal Engine 5 and assets from the Unreal Marketplace. The scene supports ray
tracing and a full sun-moon cycle system. At the same time, the new global
foliage system provided by Unreal 5 is used to simulate real foliage
physics.</p>
<h3 id="Gundam-3d-model-scanning-and-modeling">Gundam 3D model scanning and modeling</h3>
<p>Use a reality capture program to scan real-life models and import them into
modeling software like Maya or Blender. At the same time, you can also use
Unreal 5&#39;s nanite system to directly import models into Unreal 5 for use.</p>
<h3 id="sunflower-calendar">Sunflower calendar</h3>
<p>A user-tested multifunctional calendar. The calendar has an alarm clock, work list, 
timing reminder, and other functions. Through multiple human-computer interaction tests, 
the software interface is designed so that users can use the software proficiently without additional instructions.</p>
<h3 id="Car Stream Simulator">Car Stream simulator</h3>
<p>A program in C++ to simulate the likelihood of collision accidents occurring when vehicles change lanes in congested single-lane traffic scenarios. 
The software can also analyze data such as traffic flow, average speed, and average passage duration on a single-lane road.
